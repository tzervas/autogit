Now let me create the email message with the comprehensive documentation:

I've created a comprehensive documentation structure for **AutoGit** with everything needed for development. Here's what's been delivered:

## 📦 Complete Package Includes:

### 1. **Root README.md**
Production-ready project overview with architecture diagram, quick start, features, and complete documentation index.

### 2. **.github/agents/agent.md** (CRITICAL)
Comprehensive AI agent configuration featuring:
- **Documentation Tracking Protocol** - Ensures docs stay current
- **Complete component documentation** with references
- **Agentic Persona System** - 5 specialized roles including Documentation Engineer
- **Development standards** with real code examples
- **Documentation Update Checklist** - 10+ items to verify
- **PR template** requiring documentation proof

### 3. **docs/INDEX.md**
Complete documentation map with:
- Full tree structure
- Topic-based navigation
- Role-based guides (New Users, Developers, Operators, Architects)
- ADR index
- 40+ documentation files mapped

### 4. **docs/development/setup.md**
Detailed environment setup with prerequisites, IDE configuration, development workflow, troubleshooting, and Makefile commands.

### 5. **docs/development/testing.md**
Comprehensive testing guide covering unit/integration/E2E testing, coverage (80%+ required), factories, mocking, CI/CD integration, and debugging.

### 6. **docs/architecture/adr/** (ADR system)
Complete ADR system with README, template, and example ADR-001 (Traefik vs NGINX decision).

## 🎯 Key Innovations:

1. **Documentation Tracking Built-In** - Agent guidelines REQUIRE docs to be updated with code
2. **Documentation Engineer Persona** - Dedicated AI role for doc maintenance
3. **Auto-Validated INDEX** - CI/CD checks all links
4. **Role-Based Navigation** - Find docs by your role (developer, operator, architect)
5. **License Compliance Enforced** - Every dependency must be checked and documented

## ⚠️ Critical Features:

- **Documentation IS code** - Same commit, same rigor
- **INDEX.md is source of truth** - All docs mapped
- **ADRs required** - All architecture decisions tracked
- **80%+ test coverage** - Enforced in CI
- **SOLID principles** - Applied throughout

The email draft contains a summary you can send, and the artifact contains all 7 complete documentation files ready for the repository.
